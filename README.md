npm install
Once all packages have been installed, it is recommended to perform a test run to make sure everything is working properly. Use the following command in your terminal for the test run:

npm run test
If the test was successful, it is time to implement webpack. Use the following command that will create a dist folder in your root folder structure together with a main.js and main.css file.

npm run build-prod
The server can now be started. In order to do so, type the following command in your terminal:

npm run start
Open a browser and connect to http://localhost:8080. You are now set up to fully use the travel planner web app.
